After Java 6 it took almost five years to create a new Java major release. In
the meantime the original Java inventor *Sun Microsystems* have been acquired in
2010. Java 7 is the first release under new owner *Oracle*.

One of the reasons for the long delay of Java 7 was the long design and development
time for a *lambda* syntax for the Java language. While this feature was finally
dropped from Java 7 the required mechanics under the hood like `INVOKEDYNAMIC`
and method handles have been added to the Java runtime with this release.

The contents of Java 7 is specified in the umbrella [JSR 336](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=336).
