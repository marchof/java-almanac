description: Class file version for each JDK release

Each JDK Release comes with its class file version. Class files are backward
compatible. But class files compiled for newer JDK releases cannot be executed
and will result in an `UnsupportedClassVersionError`.

The following table lists class file versions for each JDK release. Follow the
linked JDK information to find download options for a suitable JDK.
