{{< jdkdetails "6" >}}

This is the first release after Sun Microsystems open sourced Java SE under the
GPLv2 license.

The release primarily added new APIs, for example a full web services stack
including several XML processing APIs. A step that was reverted 12 years
later, when these APIs were [removed](../11/apidiff/6/) again.

The contents of Java 6 is specified in the umbrella [JSR 270](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=270).
