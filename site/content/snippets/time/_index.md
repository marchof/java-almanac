Support for international date/time calculations was very limited in the
early years of Java. In this vacuum the [Joda-Time](https://www.joda.org/joda-time/)
by Stephen Colebourne became the de-facto standard for advanced date/time logic
which finally became part of the JDK
([Java 8](../../jdk/8), [JEP 150](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/150)).
The package `java.time`
provides a solid API for date/time calculations and local representations of
time stamps in different calendar systems.
